## Open follow-ups and shortcuts

- **G0 exit check wording:** `git diff 1061ea8 -- InpremClockingApp/` is not empty; it contains one new file, `InpremClockingApp/Properties/AssemblyInfo.Tests.cs` (`InternalsVisibleTo` for the test projects, approved by the developer 2026-10-12). Read the check as "no existing application file changed".
- **Model drift check:** the installed `dotnet-ef` global tool is 10.0.8 and does not recognise `migrations has-pending-model-changes`. Phase 0 needs a working drift check: install a matching `dotnet-ef` 8.x as a local tool, or add a test that compares the model to the migrations snapshot.
- **Container DB mode not yet exercised:** Docker is installed but its engine was not running, so tests ran on LocalDB (`INPREM_TEST_DB=localdb`, the Windows default). `container` mode is used for the first time by CI (Step 3) or when Docker Desktop is started; `external` mode is for CI's service container.
- **Test-host differences from a normal run** (all in `InpremAppFactory`): environment `Testing` (no user-secrets or per-environment appsettings), `SeedAdmin`/`SeedSuperAdmin` blanked, in-memory data-protection keys, `BillingBackgroundService` not started.
- **House organization in every new database:** migration `MultiTenancy_Phase1a_BackfillTenantData` inserts "Inprem Holistic Community Resource Center" as tenant 1. The seed catalog exposes it as `House`; Alpha, Beta and Gamma are tenants 2–4.
- **Playwright browsers** are a one-time install per machine: `pwsh tests/InpremClockingApp.Tests.Ui/bin/Debug/net8.0/playwright.ps1 install chromium` (CI must do the same).

_(date — phase/step — summary — tests — next)_

- **2026-10-12 — G0 / Step 1 — Test infrastructure.**
  - Added test projects: `InpremClockingApp.Tests.Support` (shared harness), `InpremClockingApp.Tests.Baseline`, `InpremClockingApp.Tests.Ui`, and empty `Inprem.Platform.Tests.Unit`, `.Integration` and `.Architecture`. `tests/Directory.Build.props` makes warnings errors for all of them.
  - Harness: `TestSqlServer` provisions the database, chosen by `INPREM_TEST_DB` (`localdb`, `container` or `external`). `AppFixture` creates a fresh database, migrates it, starts the unchanged app and seeds data; the database is dropped on dispose. `KestrelAppFixture` adds a real port for Playwright. `SignIn` posts the real login form.
  - Seed data (`TestDataSeeder`/`SeedCatalog`): Alpha (America/New_York) and Beta (Europe/London) each have an owner, an admin, 3 staff and 3 volunteers, with sessions on 4 days including the spring daylight-saving change (8 Mar / 29 Mar 2026). Gamma is empty. The admin password is generated per run.
  - Tests: Baseline 8/8 passed (infrastructure: app starts, seed counts, DST rows stored in UTC, no configuration-seeded accounts, login redirect to `/VolunteerAttendance`, wrong password, anonymous redirect). UI 1/1 passed (`--filter Category=Ui`; plain `dotnet test` skips it). Platform projects have no tests yet.
  - Next: Step 2, the behaviour baseline suite.
